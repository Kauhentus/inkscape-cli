# inkscape-cli

inkscape-cli is a Node.js binding for Inkscape's command line interface.

#### Quick start:
Import the library into your code and start coding!

```js
const I = require('inkscape-cli');

const save_as_pdf = I.generate_command([
    I.O.file('.\\File.svg'),
    I.O.export_area_page,
    I.O.export_pdf('.\\File.pdf')
]);
I.run_command(save_as_pdf);
```

# Documentation

#### setFolder(path)
Tells inkscape-cli that `inkscape.exe` is in the folder specified by `path`.

param | type | description
--- | --- | ---
**path** | `String` | Path to Inkscape's folder

```js
I.inkscape_folder("C:\\Program Files\\Inkscape\\");
```
- Path must use `\\` instead of `/`
- It's ok to leave spaces in the path
#### O
inkscape-cli has an object called `O`. `O` has all the options one can use when creating a command with `generateCommand`. Go to https://inkscape.org/doc/inkscape-man.html for specific details about each command. 

Here are some examples:
```js
I.O.file('.\\File.svg');
I.O.export_area_drawing;
I.O.export_png('.\\File Image.png');
```
File paths need to use `\\` instead of `/`. Feel free to leave spaces in a filepath as well.
Options with no parameter can be left without `()`. Options that do need parameters can put them in via a function call.
#### generateCommand(args)
Generates a command inkscape-cli can run.

param | type | description
--- | --- | ---
**args** | `Array` | An array of `I.O.` values

```js
const savePDF = I.generateCommand([
    I.O.file('.\\File.svg'),
    I.O.export_area_page,
    I.O.export_pdf('.\\File.pdf')
]);
const savePNG = I.generateCommand([
    I.O.file('.\\File.svg'),
    I.O.export_area_drawing,
    I.O.export_width(2024),
    I.O.export_height(1024),
    I.O.export_png('.\\File.png')
]);
```

#### runCommand(command)
Runs a command generated by `generateCommand`

param | type | description
--- | --- | ---
**command** | `String` | A command created by `generateCommand`

```js
I.runCommand(savePDF);
```
#### chainCommands(commands)
Runs multiple commands one at a time

param | type | description
--- | --- | ---
**commands** | `Array<String>` | Array of commands created by `generateCommand`
```js
I.chainCommands([savePDF, savePNG]);
```
